## Sample math in Markdown format


### Integration

As the derivative of \\( \sin x \\) is \\( \cos x \\), and that of \\( \cos x \\)  is \\( -\sin x \\), we have

\\[ \int_{a}^{b}\cos x dx = \sin b - \sin a, \qquad    \int_{a}^{b}\sin x dx = \cos a - \cos b. \\]
   
Isn't that beautiful?

### Syntax

Notice we use the new LaTeX formatting codes

```
\\( inline formulas \\)
\\[ display formulas \\]
```
rather than the dollar/double dollar syntax we are used to in classic LaTeX.
