Sample math in RST format
=========================
Let us do some maths here!



Integration
-----------

As the derivative of :math:`\sin x` is :math:`\cos x`, and that of :math:`\cos x` is :math:`-\sin x`, we have

.. math::

   \int_{a}^{b}\cos x dx = \sin b - \sin a
   
   \int_{a}^{b}\sin x dx = \cos a - \cos b
   
Isn't that beautiful?
